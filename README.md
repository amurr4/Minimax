# Data Science Portfolio : Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning Tic-Tac-Toe

### Overview
Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository showcases my project, the minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning in Tic-Tac-Toe.

### Description: 
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two player game where players take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. Playing this game against human players is a lot easier than playing against a computer. Why? A computer can look multiple moves ahead. This makes the computer way better than a human, as we may only be able to look a few moves ahead. In this project, I coded a computer playing tic-tac-toe using the Minimax algorithm. The minimax algorithm is used in computer games often, where the goal of the computer is to maximize it's score while minimizing the other players score at the same time. Alpha-beta pruning is used in this project to decrease the search space while the computer figures out it's next move.

### Technologies Used
Visual Studio, Python

### Expected Outcomes
The creation of a user-friendly gaming experience that allows human players to compete against the computer, highlighting the challenges posed by the computer's advanced lookahead capabilities. The integration of the Minimax algorithm to enable the computer player to make optimal moves by considering multiple future possibilities. Successful application of Alpha-beta pruning that enhances the computational efficiency of the algorithm by reducing the search space during the computer's decision-making process. And overall, an increased understanding of game theory, algorithmic decision-making, and the application of artificial intelligence concepts in game development.
