## Projects

### Project 1: []

- Description: Briefly describe the project, including its goals and objectives.
- Technologies Used: List the tools and libraries used in the project (e.g., Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Scikit-learn).
- Link to Project: Provide a link to the GitHub repository or any live demos if available.

### Project 3: [Alpha-Beta Pruning Tic-Tac-Toe]

- Description: Tic-Tac-Toe is a two player game where players take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. Playing this game against human players is a lot easier than playing against a computer. Why? A computer can look multiple moves ahead. This makes the computer way better than a human, as we may only be able to look a few moves ahead. In this project, I coded a computer playing tic-tac-toe using the Minimax algorithm. The minimax algorithm is used in computer games often, where the goal of the computer is to maximize it's score while minimizing the other players score at the same time. Alpha-beta pruning is used in this project to decrease the search space while the computer figures out it's next move. 
- Technologies Used: Visual Studio, Python 
- Link to Project: Provide a link to the GitHub repository or any live demos if available.
